# Fire Explorer

_Part of a collection of tools used to provide access to NSW bushfire data_: [Importer](https://github.com/DylanFM/incident-worker) and [GeoJSON API](https://github.com/DylanFM/bushfires)

## [map.bushfir.es](http://map.bushfir.es/)

Fire Explorer provides an alternative means to access [data](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?cat_id=1358) provided by the NSW Rural Fire Service.

Currently this project exists as a way for me to explore the data collected and delivered by the Bushfires API mentioned above.

The Fire Explorer app is a static [AngularJS](angularjs.org) app which has been generated by [Yeoman](yeoman.io). The app is available at http://map.bushfir.es. This deployment is hosted on S3 and distributed by Cloudfront. The maps are provided by [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com).
